His favorite subject in school is math and his favorite food is scalloped potatoes. He likes to watch the TV show Firefly and the movie Snowpiercer. If he had a million dollars, he would put most of it in savings and invest some of it in stocks or bonds.

When asked his favorites in life, he responds, “I choose no favorites.” If he had a million dollars then he would buy everyone a green dress, but not real green dresses cause that’s cruel. He is very creative and crafty so he made his ideal superpower “The ability to manipulate reality” which basically gives him any power he wants in reality.
