    <p>Noah is a senior that participated in FRC two years ago as a builder, and now he has returned to again help the build team and maybe even app design.

His favorite subject in school is math and his favorite food is scalloped potatoes. He likes to watch the TV show Firefly and the movie Snowpiercer. If he had a million dollars, he would put most of it in savings and invest some of it in stocks or bonds. His ideal superpower is something called psychokinesis, also known as the ability to move things with your mind.</p>

When asked his favorites in life, he responds, “I choose no favorites.” If he had a million dollars then he would buy everyone a green dress, but not real green dresses cause that’s cruel. He is very creative and crafty so he made his ideal superpower “The ability to manipulate reality” which basically gives him any power he wants in reality.</p>

Her hobbies are Taekwondo and ART. Yes, she draws a lot. Her favorite subject, then, would obviously be art, and she also likes history. Her favorite food for consumption is chocolate. If she had a million dollars, she would donate at least a quarter of it to local animal shelters, go to college, support her friends in college, giving most of it to others because she herself feels she doesn't deserve that much money.
